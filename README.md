# MIX Simulator 

MIX is a hypothetical computer described by Donald Knuth for 
instructive use in The Art of Computer Programming. This software
provides a simulator for MIX, written in Python 3, as well
as an assembler for the MIX Assembly Language (MIXAL).

## Development Plan 

The initial scope of this project does not extend to fully
emulating a specific architectural design. That is, accurately
specifying a pipeline and its fetch/execute cycle, enforcing the
distinction between a control unit and an ALU, etc., are not of 
predominant concern. However, future releases may broaden the
the scope of the project to accurate representation of such
lower-level details.
